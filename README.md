# QUESTION-ANSWERING-SYSTEM
Design and implement a question answering system that retrieves information from a given text corpus. Your System should accept user questions in natural language and provide accurate answers based on the content of the corpus. Consider implementing both retrieval-based and generative approaches.


This project is a Question Answering System that takes a user query as input and provides relevant answers based on a given dataset or pre-trained NLP models. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and understand questions before generating accurate responses.

Features

Accepts user queries and returns precise answers.

Uses NLP techniques for question understanding and answer extraction.

Can be extended with deep learning models for improved accuracy.

Easy-to-use interface for querying.

Technologies Used

Python (Primary language)

Jupyter Notebook (Development and experimentation)

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Hugging Face Transformers (Optional for advanced models)

Flask / FastAPI (Optional for deploying as an API)

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

pip (Python package manager)
